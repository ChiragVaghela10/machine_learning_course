Repository for the learning materials of the course 'Machine Learning Specialization' by Standford University on 
coursera.

# Course Structure
The course 'Machine Learning Specialization' consist of 3 courses:

- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Unsupervised learning, Recommender Systems and recommender systems

# Key Learnings

*Supervised Learning*

- Hypothesis approximation, decision boundaries, and patterns in data
- Feature scaling/engineering for faster convergence and types
- Normal Equation Method (for small-medium datasets)
- Linear/Logistic/SoftMax regression techniques (including multi-label vs multi-class classification)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, forward/backward propagation
- Role of hidden layer to provide abstracted/alternate representation of input by combining linear matrix 
transformations performing change of basis and non-linear activation functions (AFs) learning patterns to define 
complex decision boundaries 
- Multiple hidden layers progressively forming ‘feature hierarchy’
- Types of hidden layers (i.e. Dense, Conv) and advantages
- Common types of AFs and mathematical properties required for AFs (i.e. non-linearity, minimal computational cost, smoothness for derivability/gradients)
- Optimization algorithm (Gradient Descent)
- Loss functions and types
- Learning rate tuning, convergence check
- Model evaluation using Train/Dev/Test errors compared to base level performance
- Confusion matrix/F1-score (useful for skewed dataset)
- Concepts of underfitting/overfitting, Bias/Variance trade-off
- Steps to diagnose neural networks for performance improvement
- Implementation of MLP using NumPy (without back prop.) and TensorFlow
- Decision tree model, purity/impurity, entropy function
- Information gain (IG) based on entropy/variance for categorical/continuous features
- Tree ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost), comparison with neural networks
- Efficacy of decision trees in handling categorical and continuous features natively
- Recommender systems, finding related items
- collaborative filtering, cold start problem
- content-based filtering (retrieval and ranking)

*Unsupervised Learning*

- Gaussian distribution, Anomaly Detection Algorithm (also for skewed dataset)
- K-Means Clustering

*Reinforcement Learning (RL)*

- Concepts of state-action function (Q function), reward function, return, discount factor, policy
- Discrete and continuous states, Markov decision process (only in context of RL)
- Bellman equation, Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, ϵ-greedy policy
